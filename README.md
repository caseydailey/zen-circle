## My Final Project for the Front-End program at Nashville Software School 

### Description

  Zen Circle is an app for practicing Japanese Calligraphy. 
  
  It uses Angular and Bootstrap to build a client that consumes the Google Translate API, allowing the user to translate an english word into it's equivalent in Japanese Kanji. It creates a template of that kanji for them to trace on an HTML5 Canvas and allows them to store their drawings in Firebase and view, edit, and delete them from a home gallery.


#### Project Goals

  The focus of this project is to provide the user with a simple, unique, and enjoyable experience and showcase some of the front-end development capabilities I've picked up in this first part of the course.
